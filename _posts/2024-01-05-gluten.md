## What is Gluten?
- `Glue` in Latin
- Enable Spark with Native Vectorized Execution
- Contributed by Intel and Kyligence in 2022
    - [Gazelle](https://github.com/oap-project/gazelle_plugin)

---

## Photon
- `SIGMOD 2022`: A Fast Query Engine for Lakehouse Systems[1]
- Not open source

---

## Why we need it?

- IO bound ==> CPU bound
- JIT is not enough
    - Spark 1.4: Expression Compute
    - Spark 2.0: Stage Code Generation (Volcano Model)
- Query plan level performance improves, but not operator level
- JVM is not good for CPU instruction optimization (like SIMD)
- Existing native engine like `volex`/`clickhouse`/`arrow`

## Architecture

---

## Design Goal

- Transform Spark’s stage physical plan to Substrait plan
- Offload performance-critical data processing to native library
- Define clear JNI interfaces for native libraries
- Switch available native backends easily
- Reuse Spark’s distributed control flow
- Manage data sharing between JVM and native
- Extensible to support more native accelerators

---

## Columnar Shuffle
- Row to column
- On Shuffle Read phase

---

## Compability
- Clear JNI interface
- Spark Side: shim layer
